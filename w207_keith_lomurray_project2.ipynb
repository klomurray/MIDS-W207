    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) In this case we have a sparse matrix. KNN doesn't perform well in this space where the KNN uses the value of features to calculate the distance between them. In this case, see P2, we have almost 25% of features in the dev data missing from the training dataset. Due to the nature of the problem, having the dev data not be represented in the training data, results in a poor fit for the KNN model. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) In this case the number of observations is too low for logistic regression to out perform naive bayes. Due to the smallish number of observations, logistic regression overfits the training data. Since Naive Bayes assumes indepedence between features it performs better. Potentially, if we had a larger sample logistic regression would likely improve. \n",
    "\n",
    "c) C is the inverse of the regularization strength. Regularization penalizes large coefficients to reduce overfitting. Small C values will increase the regularization strength, which creates simpler models that under fit the data. As C increases, the squared error also increases. Since smaller values of C correspond to smaller maginitudes of error we end up with smaller squared weights. As C increases we have larger error due to more complicated models, which increases the squared weights.  "

    "Overall the bigram has a lot of 'filler' phrases such as \"is there\", \"are you\", etc. that it assigned to high weights on one category. A possible consideration is that certain people with distinct writing styles were very active in a specific topic. As a result of the smallish amount of data, the bigram model is picking these up and assigning high weights. If we had a large training set, logistic regression might improve. "

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",

The two largest R ratios were associated with religious topics that got confused with comp.graphics. Checking the documents, but mention computer related words such as FTP. Since we're using TF_IDF this makes sense that its inaccurately predicting these documents. Terms like FTP and ASCII is infrequently used in general documents, but much more likely in documents related to computers. The text that was mis-categorized, was religious content, but that was discussing stuff related to computers such as FTP. \n",
